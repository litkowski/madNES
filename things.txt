difficulties encountered:

How to emulate PPU? Why I chose high-level emulation for it
CPU addition for branches is SIGNED, not unsigned
SDL: Don't render by pixel, use a texture instead
Don't use a cycle_ppu() function, it's 10x slower

18686 is current position, jump  to instruction, possible break?
c5d8 - nestest.nes input polling

nestest.nes - after polling does:
lsra, rol, dex,

bug - using 0xF0 to test for page crossing instead of 0xFF00 for branch

last problem solved - nestest cycle #585, ADC carry flag being set incorrectll

current problem - around cycle 2547, weird issue because codes seem to be loaded
into 0 when not encountering bugs. something with addressing modes? might need to change log so i can just run diff on it

using push_events_read instead of push_events_read_mod_write for LSR dbus
