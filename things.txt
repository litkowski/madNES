difficulties encountered:

How to emulate PPU? Why I chose high-level emulation for it
CPU addition for branches is SIGNED, not unsigned
SDL: Don't render by pixel, use a texture instead
Don't use a cycle_ppu() function, it's 10x slower

18686 is current position, jump  to instruction, possible break?
